        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Rafael Longhi, a 17-year-old developer with a passion for technology and innovation. I've been coding since I was 10, starting with simple scripts and gradually expanding my skills across multiple programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, Lua, and C#. My journey in the tech world has been both challenging and rewarding, and I'm always eager to learn and grow.</p>
    
        <p>One of the highlights of my experience was participating in the OBR (Olimpíada Brasileira de Robótica), where I secured 3rd place in the regional competition and 6th place in the state-level competition. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also taught me the value of teamwork, problem-solving, and perseverance.</p>
    
        <p>Currently, my main focus is on preparing for the ENEM and working on an exciting project—Aegis, a game that combines my love for coding and creativity. I'm always exploring new technologies and working on personal projects that challenge my skills and fuel my passion.</p>
    
        <p>Looking ahead, I aspire to study Computer Engineering at UTFPR and join the Apple Developer Academy. I believe that these opportunities will allow me to deepen my knowledge, connect with like-minded individuals, and contribute to innovative projects that can make a difference.</p>
    
        <p>Outside of coding, I have a strong interest in video games and music, which not only provide me with relaxation but also inspire my work as a developer. Whether it's exploring new game mechanics or composing music, I find these hobbies to be a great source of creativity and motivation.</p>
    
        <p>I'm excited about the future and the possibilities it holds, and I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Let's connect and create something amazing together!</p>
